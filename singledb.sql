/*
 * Brief: This Script allows an RDS Postgres User to remove latency related
 * side-effects of the Lazy Loading feature of EBS when subjecting it
 * to actual Production Workload.
 *
 * You can read more about the Lazy Loading feature of EBS here[1].
 *
 * Background: When an RDS Postgres instance is restored from an existing
 * Snapshot, the Lazy Loading feature of EBS allows one to launch any instance
 * (even as large as 16 TB) in a matter of minutes. The flip-side to that 
 * feature, is the first fetch (of each disk-block) requested by RDS Postgres,
 * is going to be fetched from S3, which in-turn is a high-latency operation.
 *
 * This SQL Script can be used to prefetch all disk-blocks of a recently
 * restored RDS Postgres Instance, which although would also experience
 * lazy-loading related side-effects, however, production workload sent to the
 * RDS instance immediately thereafter can be guaranteed to not see these
 * side-effects.
 *
 * Notably, it tries to fetch all the following (associated to a DB User):
 * 1) Table / Materialized View etc.
 * 2) Large Objects (if any)
 * 3) For TOAST data prefetch (please see toast.sql)
 *
 * Importantly, do note that owing to how Postgres object permissions work,
 * this Script needs to be run once each per DB User / per Database. This can
 * be run in parallel (although the idea is to ensure that they all run
 * successfully, i.e. give an output at the end).
